# The path to react-native-app - 
### First steps into React Native


We create this new app to invstigate how to work with React Native, here i use tools like "Expo" that help so much.
it's so different from React js, well, all the structure of building components, how to reuse nesting styles, the animations.
I think that it's very interesting about to have a powerfull way to create an application for every mobile plattaform as an app, also having the oportunity of compile it directly. 

Libraries used:

- "expo": "~40.0.0"   // excelent library for first steps helps a lot
- "@expo-google-fonts/roboto": "^0.1.0" // importing Roboto fonts in a different way
- "expo-font": "~8.4.0" // manage fonts inside the app
- "expo-status-bar": "~1.0.3" // manage status bar of ios android
- "react-native-image-overlay": "^0.1.2" // manage images overlay
- "react-native-svg": "12.1.0" // to set an SVG as a component
